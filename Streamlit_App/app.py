## Problem Statement
The primary objective of this project is to build a machine learning classification model that can predict the sentiment of IMDb movie reviews.
The dataset contains a collection of movie reviews, and each review is labeled as either positive or negative.

# Future Work Note

### Future Work
I attempted to train models using BART and LSTM; however, the training process on Google Colab consistently stopped automatically after approximately 1.5 hours. Despite trying multiple times, I faced the same issue. In the future, I aim to replace the current models with higher accuracy models once the computational limitations are resolved.
